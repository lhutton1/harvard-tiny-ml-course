# Applications of TinyML
This course explores the machine learning workflow from training to edge device. It details common tools used for model optimisation and applications of TinyML on edge devices. The notebooks should be accessed in the following order:

1. [Post traning optimization and quantization](./post-training-optimisation.ipynb)
2. [Quantization aware training](./quantization-aware-training.ipynb)
3. [Preprocessing audio samples](./preprocessing-audio-samples.ipynb)
